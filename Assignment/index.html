            A.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library that simplifies HTML document traversing, event handling, animating, and Ajax interactions for rapid web development. It was created by John Resig in 2006 and is now maintained by the jQuery team.
            <br>
            One of the biggest benefits of jQuery is that it abstracts away many of the differences between browsers, making it easier to write cross-browser compatible code. This has made it a popular tool for web developers for many years. However, with the advent of modern web frameworks and native browser features, the popularity of jQuery has diminished somewhat in recent years.

<h2> Q.2 How to Apply CSS Using JQuery, How to Add Class and Remove Class in JQuery,
    JQuery Animation?</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="container-answer">
<h3> A.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; To apply CSS using jQuery, you can use the .css() method, which allows you to get or set CSS properties of selected elements. Here's an example:
    <br>
    <div class="img"><img src="images/img1.png" alt=""></div>
    <br>
    To add or remove a class using jQuery, you can use the .addClass() and .removeClass() methods, respectively. Here's an example:
    <br>
    <div class="img"><img src="images/img2.png" alt=""></div>
    <br>
    To perform animations using jQuery, you can use the .animate() method, which allows you to animate CSS properties over a period of time. Here's an example:
    <br>
    <div class="img"><img src="images/img3.png" alt=""></div>
    <br>
    In this example, the div element's width will change gradually from its current width to 500 pixels over a period of 1 second (1000 milliseconds). You can also chain multiple animations together using the .animate() method, like this:
    <br>
    <div class="img"><img src="images/img4.png" alt=""></div>
    <br>
    These are just a few examples of what you can do with jQuery. There are many other methods and features available, so I encourage you to check out the jQuery documentation for more information.

    Q.3  How to create slider with animation?
</h2>
        </div>
        <div class="container-answer">
<h3>
    A.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; To create a slider with animation using jQuery, you can follow these general steps:
    <br>
    <ol class="order">
        <li>Create the HTML markup for the slider, typically using a container element and a set of slide elements nested inside it.</li>
        <li>Use CSS to style the slider and position the slide elements within it.</li>
        <li>Use jQuery to initialize the slider, selecting the container element and setting any necessary configuration options.</li>
        <li>Write a function that handles the animation of the slider, typically using the .animate() method to change the CSS properties of the slide elements over time.</li>
        <li>Attach event handlers to any controls (such as buttons or pagination) that allow the user to interact with the slider, triggering the animation function as needed.</li>

        </ol>
        <br>
        Here's a basic example that demonstrates how to create a simple slider with jQuery:
        <br>
        HTML markup:
        <br>
        <div class="img"><img src="images/img5.png" alt=""></div>
        <br>
        CSS styling:
        <br>
        <div class="img"><img src="images/img6.png" alt=""></div>
        <br>
        JavaScript code:
        <br>
        
        <div class="img"><img src="images/img7.png" alt=""></div>
        <div class="img"><img src="images/img8.png" alt=""></div>
